# Agent instructions

The parent `/Users/maca5/codes/fiducia-cloud/AGENTS.md` and `.github/agents.md`
apply. Work directly on `main`; coordinate ownership before editing; preserve
unrelated changes; and do not use destructive Git or filesystem commands.

`formal/app_lifecycle.qnt` is normative. Any lifecycle change must update the
Quint model, deterministic Quint traces, the Dart implementation, bounded Dart
tests, the Rust companion implementation and tests, and both formal-model
copies together. The two `.qnt` source pairs must remain byte-identical.

UI code must derive capabilities from `AppSnapshot`. Adapters may execute only
effects emitted by `AppLifecycleMachine` and must return completions with the
exact operation generation. Do not add independent authentication, tenant,
offline, confirmation, reconciliation, recovery, or sign-out booleans.

Never describe randomized or bounded verification as an unbounded proof. A
release requires platform-specific build and acceptance evidence in addition
to the formal and implementation checks.
